Show-DscResource
================ 

Show-DscResource, is an add-on to Powershell ISE, which aids in composing configurations by presenting you with information about all the DSC resources currently residing in your system. 
This would incur a one time load , that will avoid hassles of querying properties of resources each time.

Install 
--------------

1. Copy **ShowDscResourceModule** directory onto some location <path1>
2. Open a Powershell ISE Window and run these commands :

```powershell
Import-Module <path1>/ShowDscResourceModule
Install-DscResourceAddOn
```

Usage
-------
Check out the [video](http://youtu.be/YaboAX1-VKc) for detailed instructions on how to use this.

Would love to address issues if any.
